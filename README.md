# supervenn: a tool to visualize relations of ana arbitrary number of sets in Python using matplotlib

### Installation
`pip install supervenn`

### Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib` at least version 3.0.3

### Basic usage 
The main entry point is the eponymous supervenn function
```python
from supervenn import supervenn
sets = [{1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 5, 6}]
supervenn(sets, side_plots=False)
```

Each row is a set, the order from bottom to top is the same as in the `sets` list. 

The numbers at the bottom show the sizes of all intersections, aka **chunks**. The sizes of sets and their intersections (chunks) are up to proportion.

The algorithm automatically chooses an order of the chunks (the colimns of the array plotted) to minimize the number of parts, in which the sets are broken. As you can see, there is only one gap inside all rows, namely in the blue set. This is achieved using a quasi-greedy optimization algorithm with randomization.

By default, additional *side plots* are also displayed:

```python
supervenn(sets)
```

Here, the numbers on the right are the set sizes, and numbers on the top show how many sets does this intersection make part of. The grey bars underneath represent the same numbers visually.

### Most important arguments
- `set_annotations`: names to be displayed in each row instead of `Set_0`, `Set_1` etc.
- `figsize`: the figure size in inches; calling `plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))` and `supervenn` afterwards
 will not work, because the function makes its own figure. **TODO**: dpi
- `side_plots`: `True` (default) or `False`, as shown above.
- `sets_ordering`: `None` (default - keep the order of sets as passed into function), `'minimize gaps'` (use same quasi-greedy algorithm to group similar sets closer together), `'size'`(bigger sets go first), `'chunk count'` (sets that contain most chunks go first), `'random'`.
- `widths_minmax_ratio`: `None` (default) or a number `0 < r <= 1`. Useful in case the chunks (intersections) are very different in sizes. Will map the chunk sizes according to `w -> a * w + b` so that the minimal to maximal chunk width ratio is no smaller than `widths_minmax_ratio`. The exact proportionality is lost in this case. Setting `widths_minmax_ratio=1` will result in all chunks being displayed as same size (no proportionalty at all.)
- `col_annotations_ys_count`: 1 (default), 2, or 3 - also helps to reduce clutter in column annotations area.

Other arguments can be found in the docstring to the function.

### Less trivial example 1: words of different categories

```python
letters = {'a', 'r', 'c', 'i', 'z'}
programming_languages = {'python', 'r', 'c', 'c++', 'java', 'julia'}
animals = {'python', 'buffalo', 'turkey', 'cat', 'dog', 'robin'}
geographic_places = {'java', 'buffalo', 'turkey', 'moscow'}
names = {'robin', 'julia', 'alice', 'bob', 'conrad'}
green_things = {'python', 'grass'}
sets = [letters, programming_languages, animals, geographic_places, names, green_things]
labels = ['letters', 'programming languages', 'animals', 'geographic places',
          'human names', 'green things']
supervenn(sets, labels)
```

### Less trivial example 2: order IDs in a vehicle routing problem solver tasks.
This was actually my motivation in creating this package. The [team I'm currently working in](https://yandex.ru/routing/) provides an API that solves a variation of the Multiple Vehicles Routing Problem. The API solves tasks of the form "Given 1000 delivery orders each with lat, lon, time window and weight, and here are 50 vehicles each with capacity and work shift, distribute the orders between the vehicles and build an optimal route for each vehicle". A given client can send hundreds of such requests per day and sometimes it is usefult to look at their requests and understand how they are related to each other in terms of what orders (indetified by, say their ID numbers) are included in each of the request. Are they sending the same task over and over again (a sign that they are not satisfied with routes they get), or are they solving different tasks?

**TBD**
